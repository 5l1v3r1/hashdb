Welcome to hashdb!

The hashdb tools are used for finding blacklist data in raw media
by using cryptographic hashes calculated from hash blocks.

The toolset provides facilities for creating hash databases
of MD5 hashes on files aligned along hash block boundaries as well as querying
hash databases, merging hash databases, and performing hash lookups.
Multiple map types are supported, allowing for specific optimizations.
Hash databases may be imported and exported in DFXML format.

The hashdb toolset includes the hashdb tool, hashdb library file
libhashdb.a, and header file hashdb.hpp.


Downloads and Websites
----------------------
The hashdb toolset is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac users.
Please see the hashdb Wiki home page at https://github.com/simsong/hashdb/wiki


Downloading the Development Tree
--------------------------------
Download the sources with git:

  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/simsong/hashdb.git


Installing Dependencies
-----------------------
A development envirnment and libraries are required.  The following steps
install requisite dependencies on Fedora 19.

   $ sudo yum update
   $ sudo yum groupinstall development-tools
   $ sudo yum install zeromq3-devel libxml2-devel openssl-devel tre-devel
   $ sudo yum install boost-devel

Not all development tools are required.  The following should be sufficient
in place of "sudo yum groupinstall development-tools":

   $ sudo yum install git gcc gcc-c++ autoconf automake libtool


Compiling hashdb
----------------
hashdb builds with the GNU auto tools. The maintainer has
prevously run automake and autoconf to produce the script
"configure". This script *should* be able to compile hashdb
for your platform. 

We recommend compiling hashdb with -O3 and that is the
default. You can disable all optimization flags by specifying the
configure option --with-noopt.

To install on a Linux/MacOS system, use:
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

If you do not wish to run sudo, please install hashdb on linux/MacOS
under $HOME/local as follows:
   $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/ --exec-prefix=$HOME/local CPPFLAGS=-I$HOME/local/include/ LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/local/lib/
   $ make
   $ install

The following files are installed:
   bin/hashdb
   include/hashdb.hpp
   lib/libhashdb.la
   lib/libhashdb.a
   share/man/man1/hashdb.1


Linking hashdb into another application such as bulk_extractor
--------------------------------------------------------------
If you wish to install at default paths, which requires sudo, type this:
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

If you wish to install at $HOME/local, which does not require sudo, type this:
   $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/ --exec-prefix=$HOME/local CPPFLAGS=-I$HOME/local/include/ LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/local/lib/
   $ make
   $ install

================================================================

To cross-compile from Fedora 19 to Windows, do the following:
   1) Set up the mingw cross compiler environment:
      $ cd src_win; ./CONFIGURE_F19.sh; cd ..
   2) type "make win32" or "make win64", or to create a windows
      installer, type "cd src_win; make".


INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES ON UBUNTU:

On Ubuntu 12.04, install packages using apt-get.

INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES ON MAC:

We recommend installing Mac dependencies using the MacPorts system. Once that is installed, try:

  $ sudo port install autoconf automake libxml2-devel zeromq3

Note that port installs to /opt/local/bin, so file /etc/paths may need to be updated
to include /opt/local/bin.
