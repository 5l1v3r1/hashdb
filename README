Welcome to hashdb!

The hashdb tools are used for finding blacklist data in raw media
by using chunk hashes.

The toolset provides facilities for creating hash databases
of MD5 hashes on files along chunk boundaries as well as querying
hash databases, merging hash databases, and performing hash lookups.
Multiple map types are supported, allowing for specific optimizations.
Hash databases may be imported and exported in DFXML format.

The hashdb toolset includes hashdb_manager, hashdb_checker, and
hashdb library files hashdb.hpp and libhashdb.a.

Download the sources with git:

  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/simsong/hashdb.git


Compiling hashdb
----------------

hashdb builds with the GNU auto tools. The maintainer has
prevously run automake and autoconf to produce the script
"configure". This script *should* be able to compile hashdb
for your platform. 

We recommend compiling hashdb with -O3 and that is the
default. You can disable all optimizaiton flags by specifying the
configure option --with-noopt.

hashdb requires additional packages:
    zeromq3-devel
    libxml2-devel
    openssl-devel
    tre-devel
    boost-devel

To install on a Linux/MacOS system, use:
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ sudo make install


Running "sudo make install" is not required.  In a default Fedora
configuration, "make" creates executables here:
   src/hashdb_manager
   src/hashdb_checker/hashdb_checker
   src/libhashdb/.libs/libhashdb.la
   src/libhashdb/.libs/libhashdb.a

In a default Fedora configuration, "sudo make install" installs
files here:
   /usr/local/bin/hashdb_manager
   /usr/local/bin/hashdb_checker
   /usr/local/lib/hashdb/libhashdb.la
   /usr/local/lib/hashdb/libhashdb.a

================================================================

INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES ON FEDORA
For FC18, perform the following setup:

   $ sudo yum update
   $ sudo yum groupinstall development-tools
   $ sudo yum install zeromq3-devel libxml2-devel openssl-devel tre-devel
   $ sudo yum install boost-devel

To cross-compile from Fedora 18 to Windows, do the following:
   1) Set up the mingw cross compiler environment:
      $ cd src_win; ./CONFIGURE_F18.sh; cd ..
   2) type "make win32" or "make win64" or, to also create a windows
      installer, thpe "cd src_win; make".


INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES ON UBUNTU:

On Ubuntu 12.04, this may be sufficient:

  $ sudo apt-get -y install gcc g++

Also: libxml2-devel and zeromq3

INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES ON MAC:

We recommend installing Mac dependencies using the MacPorts system. Once that is installed, try:

  $ sudo port install autoconf automake

Also: libxml2-devel and zeromq3

Note that port installs to /opt/local/bin, so file /etc/paths may need to be updated
to include /opt/local/bin.
