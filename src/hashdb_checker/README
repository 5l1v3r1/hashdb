The hashdb_checker tool is a tool for accessing the hashdb.
Interaction is performed through library libhashdb.

The hashdb_checker tool is available for post-processing services
and for testing.

Currently, not all planned interfaces are available.
Please type "hashdb_checker -h" for a usage list of what is currently
available.

Here is an example workflow for checking for hashes in a hashdb:
1) Start the hashdb_manager server lookup service:
     "hashdb_manager -c server -i your_hashdb_pathname"
2) Run hashdb_checker, providing a dfxml file containing hash values:
     "hashdb_checker your_dfxml_file"
