To run the tests: from the hashdb directory, type "make check"

Platforms: FC19, FC20, CentOS, RHEL, Win32, Win64, Mac,

Additional tests:
 * Generate a database and see that it is compatible with that generated
   on another system.
 * Run hshdb client or server on each platform.
 * Test the bulk_extractor hashdb scanner import and scan functions.

Inspect results:
 * Examine the log file to validate proper attribution management.

Valgrind:
To test for memory leaks using valgrind, type: "make run_tests_valgrind"
Expected results from running valgrind:
Client should run to completion with 0 leaks.
Server is currently not designed to abort (CNTL C) with good cleanup, so
leaks are expected.  But varying the quantity of client queries should not
change the number of leaks reported.

Testing on a remote sysem:
1) build local, so edit .bashrc to include "PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH".
2) Restart shell: ssh <place> or "ssh -t <place> screen".
   On timeout: ssh -t <place> screen -d -r"
