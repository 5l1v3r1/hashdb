hashdb Version 1.1.1 has been released for Linux, MacOS and Windows.

Release source code and Windows installer: http://digitalcorpora.org/downloads/bulk_extractor/

GIT repository: https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor

#Bug Fixes

This minor update corrects functionality of the `explain_identified_blocks` post-processing command used for post-processing the `identified_blocks.txt` feature file generated by the _bulk\_extractor_ _hashdb_ scanner running in _scan_ mode.

Processing for this command now works as follows:

* All hashes in the `identified_blocks.txt` input file are added into an `identified_hashes` set.
For each hash, if its count of associated sources does not exceed a maximum threshold, then each source is added into an `identified_sources` set.

* Then, for each hash in the set:
 * If the hash is from any sources in the `identified_sources` set then:
  * Print the hash along with 1) each identified source and 2) the total count identified for the hash.
