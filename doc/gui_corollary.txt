A hashdb GUI is not scheduled for development.
The notes here are for reference only and are provided to help illustrate
how the GUI view would map to typed hashdb commands.

Main screen:

category name         button name
-------------         -----------

New Database          create

Import/Export         import
                      export

etc.

-------------------------------------
For each button press, a new screen would open.
Screens may have buttons for activating a file chooser
or text boxes for options or values.

Some screens are described here:

create: include text boxes for options and a finder box for the new directory.

import: This may have additional buttons to help set up to import
using md5deep or fiwalk.
