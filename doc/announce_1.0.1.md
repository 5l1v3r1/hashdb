		Announcing hashdb 1.0.1
		        <DATE>

hashdb Version 1.0.1 has been released for Linux, MacOS and Windows.

Major improvements
==================

Bug Fixes
=========
* Improve error detection and reporting in the event of invalid input
    * Discontinued command options -t, -a, and -b are removed.  Use of these options now provide an error rather than quietly disregarding their use.
    * Improve wording for the change report written to stdout.
    * Detect when the database configuration is different from the hashdb configuration, and fail gracefully.
    * Detect when multiple databases being referenced are not compatible with each other, specifically, if their hash block size is different or if the databases is the same one.
* Fix so test suite builds for Windows.
* Fix the command test so that it does not add a database to itself.  This is an error condition and it can corrupt the database.
* Add more validation checks to the commands test set.
* Add the Users Manual to the distribution.
* Reorganize and add content to the Users Manual.
* Organize the commands in the usage text into categories, and fix and clarify usage language.
* Set endian module to revision sha1=05ac935 since the newer endian module is not compatible with available Boost versions.
* Improve usability of the deduplicate command by creating the target database if it is not already there.
* Improve parsability of output from the expand_identified_blocks command by changing space to underscore.
* Improve parsability of output from the scan_expanded command by changing space to underscore.
* Remove compiler warning generated by the clang compiler.
* Improve the import command performance by importing hashes as they are read from the DFXML file rather than buffering them all before importing them.  This change also improves runtime progress feedback.
