		Announcing hashdb 0.9.0
		  September 27, 2013

hashdb Version 0.9.0 has been released for Linux, MacOS and Windows.

Version 0.9.0 is the introductory release of hashdb.

Please see https://github.com/simsong/hashdb/wiki.

hashdb enables examiners to search for blacklist data in raw media by
using cryptographic hashes calculated from hash blocks.

hashdb tools provide two fundamental services:
* Creating and maintaining hash databases containing cryptographic hashes
  of hash blocks.
* Interfaces for searching these hash databases for matching hash values.

The hashdb toolset provides the following resources:
* hashdb_manager tool:
  This program is used to build and manage hash
  datagases and to support hash database lookups.
* hashdb library:
  Programs such as the bulk_extractor hashid scanner
  link this library to support hash database lookups.
* hashdb_checker tool:
  Used to support hash database lookups

Starting with bulk_extractor v1.4.1, bulk_extractor provides the hashid
scanner for scanning for matching hash values.
