Not all tests are automated.

* To run most tests, type "make check" in the build directory.
* To run memory analysis tests, after "make install", run memory_analysis.sh.
* To run python binding tests, configure access to the hashdb module
  as described in the installation instructions, then run
  python_bindings/test_hashdb.py.
* To validate the distribution, type "make check".

Some tests may leave residue in the local directory in files named temp_*.
