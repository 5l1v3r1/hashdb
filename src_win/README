Set up mingw and the cross-compilation environment:
$ sudo yum -y install mingw64-gcc-c++ mingw64-zlib-static mingw64-pthreads flex 
$ sudo yum -y install autoconf automake  # not strictly needed, but necessary to build from SVN/GIT
$ sudo yum -y install zlib-devel zlib-static

1) Run script CONFIGURE_F18.sh found in directory src_win/ to set up Fedora 18
or newer to set up the mingw environment for cross-compiling to Windows.

2) Create and cd to directory win32 or win64

3) type "mingw64-configure" in directory win64 to set up the build environment
in the win64 directory

4) type "make" in the win64 directory
