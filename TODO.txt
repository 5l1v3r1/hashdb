Tasks:
* Include lists in Makefiles need to be updated.
* The Windows configuration has not been tested.
* bulk_extractor for Windows is not available.  The amount of work to
prepare this is not determined.
* Examine a file hang issue that manifests
underneath btree code when I compile with clang.  I am avoiding the
issue right now by compiling with gcc.  The issue is readily reproducible.
* Implement more database statistical reporting. 
Actual statistics to report have not been defined, but I'll find some
things to report as I test the examples.

----------------------------

Testing

Platforms: FC19, FC20, Centos, Win32, Win64, Mac,

Tests:
hashdb:
 * Run the automated test suite.
 * Generate a database and see that it is compatible with that generated
   on another system.
 * Run hshdb client or server on each platform.
   Here is the syntax using loopback socket endpoints:
   Server: hashdb server my_hashdb tcp://*:14500
   Client: hashdb scan tcp://localhost:14500 my_dfxml

bulk_extractor:
 * Run import.  Example syntax:
   bulk_extractor -S hashdb_action=scan -S path_or_socket=my_hashdb -o my_scan my_image
 * Run scan.  Example syntax:
   bulk_extractor -S hashdb_action=import -o my_scan my_image

Not completed: FC19 or FC20 compiled by clang.
When compiled by clang, there is a file access hang underneath btree.
This needs fixed.

----------------------------
Future:
Add "top ten" to show hash values with highest repeat counts.

Fix import so broken xml does not break log.xml and history.xml files.

write validation command that verifies that the duplicates count
in map match actual count in multimap.
