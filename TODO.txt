Tasks:
* The ability to query using sockets is not in place.
* The hashdb API is not threadsafe yet.
* Include lists in Makefiles need to be updated.
* The Windows configuration has not been tested.
* bulk_extractor for Windows is not available.  The amount of work to
prepare this is not determined.
* I need to coordinate about performing some level of hashdb code review. 
* I need to examin a file hang issue that manifests
underneath btree code when I compile with clang.  I am avoiding the
issue right now by compiling with gcc.  The issue is readily reproducible.
* I need to implement some amount of database statistical reporting. 
Actual statistics to report have not been defined, but I'll find some
things to report as I test the examples.

----------------------------

Testing

Platforms: FC19, FC20, Centos, Win32, Win64, Mac,
and FC19 or FC20 compiled by clang.

Tests:
Tests would be 1) that the automated test suite completes and 2) that a
generated database is compatible across FC, Win32, Win64, and Mac.


----------------------------
Note: zmq client hangs in ZMQ code when server not present.
Workaround: CTRL-C after zmq timeout message is reported.
Future workaround: may replace ZMQ with boost:asio.
