HASHDB
======
Welcome to hashdb!

hashdb is used for finding blacklist data in raw media
by using cryptographic hashes calculated from hash blocks.

The hashdb tool provides commands for creating hash databases
of MD5 hashes on files aligned along hash block boundaries as well as querying
hash databases, merging hash databases, and performing hash lookups.

hashdb provides C++ and Python interfaces for working with and scanning
hashdb databases.

hashdb builds and installs on Linux and OS X systems using
configure; make; make install.  hashdb also cross-compiles to Windows
from Fedora 20+ using mingw.
